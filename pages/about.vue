          While working in media composing and music production both on and off
          stage, we got bored by existing instruments and libraries over the
          years. We were missing inspiring signature sounds that would stand out
          and yet be adaptive and fit in when we wanted them to.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Subsequently we started designing our own cinematic soundscapes,
          organic synth sounds and so much more by experimenting with sounds of
          various instruments and everyday items and by exploring the
          opportunities of analog and digital manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          These sounds were then collected and modeled into playable Kontakt
          instruments. Ever since, they have become an invaluable part of our
          production environment. We grew so fond of them that we want to share
          these tools with you.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Our libraries don't try to imitate real instruments. Instead, they are
          tools that explore the full potential of digital sound design in order
          to both meet the needs of a professional workflow and most
          importantly, to bring bits of inspiration with them for you.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          We hope you like our signature sounds as much as we do. If we are
          missing something or if you want to leave some feedback, donâ€™t
          hesitate to do so.
